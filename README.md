# StudentMIS-JavaFile
Java Project for Second Semester

This is a sample student data management system that consists of authentication and data storage in Java Swing. 

The various concepts of Java used in completing this project include objects and classes, use of data class and constructors, Swing and AWT framework and
various types of file management classes including DataStreams and CharacterStreams.

The major use of object oriented programming in this project is in the form of Student data class that is used to build Student data, save it and retrieve it to
be displayed in the final console. The string that is read from the saved file is converted to object before being displayed in JTable.

I learnt how to use object oriented programming concepts properly, use the Oracle Java documentation, user version control systems such as git and also learnt how
to write and document code properly when completing this project.

I learnt how to design classes, passing on objects around between functions, designing UI layout in Swing and using various available functions and methods within
classes to polish the user experience in this project. On the other hand, doing the database version of this project, I learnt how to use SQLite, using JDBC and
retrieving and storing objects in database tables as well.

Reflecting back, this project has taught me a lot about desktop application development as a whole and has further inspired me to learn Swing and JavaFX
to create more applications in the future.
